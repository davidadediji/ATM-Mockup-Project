workdays = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Friday", "Saturday"]


workdays.insert(2, 'Wednesday')

print(workdays)

# workdays.append('monday')
# print(workdays)


#difference between append and insert 
#append adds a data to the end of the list 
# insert adds data to a specific index, the method takes the index and a specific value you need to add to a list...
